# HW5 Auth By Josh Kerber

## What I did

  * For this homework, I created a fully functional authentication system for my online blog. The backend database still used mongodb, and users had to enter a email, username, and password to sign up/sign in to the blog. Users couldn't post without signing in, and their username's were displayed as the author of the post.

## What worked/didn't work

  * It worked to read the documentation for mongodb. If the database wasn't up and running correctly the entire app would be sabotaged.

## Extra credit attempted

  * None
